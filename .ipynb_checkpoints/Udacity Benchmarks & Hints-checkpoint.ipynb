    "Since you're well on your way to mastering deep reinforcement learning, we won't provide too many hints for this project. That said, in our solution code, we decided to start with the DDPG code to solve this project. To adapt it to train multiple agents, we first noted that **each agent receives its own, local observation**. Thus, we can easily adapt the code to simultaneously train both agents through self-play. In our case, each agent used the same actor network to select actions, and the experience was added to a shared replay buffer.\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that the agents perform horribly starting around episode 2500 and show no evidence of recovery. However, at one point, we accomplished an average score (over 100 episodes) of +0.9148!\n",
